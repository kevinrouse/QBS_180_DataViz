## Final project for QBS 180 (Data Vizualization)
Used Tableau to visualize data about the Austin Animal Shelter to hopefully give insights into meaningful relationships.The twbx was too big to fit in github but feel free to download the csv files and you should be able to use the twb! The final presentation is also included. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjDxODQ0cuBAxWEEGIAHVmnDyQQFnoECBEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Faaronschlegel%2Faustin-animal-center-shelter-outcomes-and&usg=AOvVaw2KHQ8xla5cYeRSSLxkjhFl&opi=89978449
